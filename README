Luvit Amazon SNS client

This is a simple Amazon SNS client for luvit. The following points should be noted: 

- Does not contain response parser, messages from amazon are returned in their raw format
- no support for AddPermission, ConfirmSubscription, RemovePermission, SetSubscriptionAttributes, SetTopicAttributes
- supports only http protocol and HmacSHA1 signature method
